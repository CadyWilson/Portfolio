 # This Folder is for my SQL Projects 

 ## Project 1: Bagels and Coffee
   * This project was to understand tables and SQL as a whole. The first part of the project is simply normalizing tables.
   * The Second half is creating tables and adding information in using SQL. The editor we had to use was SQLFiddle. We also had to query our tables and show results.
