# My Ever Evolving Portfolio 

## It has various projects I've worked on over the years. 

### Some were done simply because it looked interesting to me, and some are projects I made while earning my BA in Data Analyics from WGU.

Included:
### Prosper Bank Loan Analysis - 
A look into what factors go into loan lending, and what can consumers do to have a better change to both get a loan and receive a better interest rate on it.

### Capstone Project: 
The Capstone from my BS in Data Analytics. The topic is diabetes and whether or not we could include different life fectors of patients alongside their heatlh metrics to possibly predict future cases. 

### It uses
* Logic Regression
* RandomForestClassifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors

### We Rate Dogs
was a Twitter sentiment analysis of the widely beloved WeRateDogs account. It was a project from the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree. I took the course becuase I enjoyed coding and found data analytics to be an interesting field. The course was to see if I wanted to take a full degree, and it hapily led to the BS I have now.

### End to End Heart Disease Classification
Another course I took, this time from Udemy. I just really like learning, and this was my first forray into machine learning.
